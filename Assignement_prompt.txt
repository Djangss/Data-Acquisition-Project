What worked

well : Good at optimizing performance, debugging errors. Excellent technical solutions for web scraping, spatial calculations, and data visualization.


bad : Solutions were sometimes overly complex and needed simplification. Made false assumptions about data formats and layout 

Prompts :

Create a function to scrape individual volcano pages and extract latitude, longitude, elevation, volcano type, and volcano number from the HTML structure. Handle missing data gracefully.

The scraping takes 25 minutes for 1,400 volcanoes. Implement parallel processing using ThreadPoolExecutor.

I need to find the nearest volcano to each earthquake. Is there a optimized way of comparing two spatial location ?

Make a scatter plot of earthquake magnitude vs distance to nearest volcano, with color gradient representing magnitude intensity.

Add a world map visualization showing earthquakes (blue circles sized by magnitude) and volcanoes (red triangles) with continents, coastlines, and borders as background layers.
